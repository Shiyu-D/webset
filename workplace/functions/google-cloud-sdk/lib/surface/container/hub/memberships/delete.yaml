      This command deletes the membership of a registered cluster on the Hub. It will not remove
      the Connect Agent that was installed on the cluster during cluster registration. To delete
      the membership of a registered cluster and remove the Connect Agent, consider using the
      command: `{parent_command} unregister`.

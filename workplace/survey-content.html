		There is increasing evidence that reading novels has a high degree of empathy, which can improve interpersonal relationships and social cohesion.However, there is an urgent need to better understand the complex link between fiction and compassion. In particular, we need to understand the full range of readers' positive and negative emotional responses to novels. Understanding these emotional "hot spots" can optimize the reading process, including guided single reading, face-to-face activities such as book clubs and festivals, and book discussions using digital media to enhance understanding of relationships and social cohesion.

		The project will investigate populations in specific backgrounds for data analysis. The website and related web applications will display statistics about books and emotions related to books, people, and genres.
